# SETS-Project

The recent advances in Automated Text Summarization (ATS) underscore the need for meticulous research on pathways to enhance the quality of text summaries. As the landscape of ATS evaluation diversifies, identifying common scenarios, benchmark datasets, and conducting systematic literature reviews of text summarization methods and metrics becomes paramount. In this context, the **Scalable Evaluation of Text Summarization (SETS) project** emerges as a pivotal initiative. SETS proposes a novel framework for evaluating ATS techniques across various disciplines, tailored to both seen and unseen text documents. This framework distinguishes itself through the adoption of state-of-the-art graph-based knowledge representation, leveraging an ontology to formalise the theoretical concepts critical for ATS systematically.

The development of a knowledge graph base for ATS evaluation through this ontology is vital for the systematic formalization of ATS's core theoretical concepts. By creating a standardized concept library, SETS provides computer-interpretable definitions of key ATS concepts and their interrelations, enriching the ecosystem for ATS evaluation. This comprehensive approach, based on a thorough review of ATS evaluation methods and the formalization of these insights at a conceptual level through ontology, enables complex reasoning and deepens the understanding of ATS concepts among users and developers alike.

SETS encompasses a wide array of scenarios, including the summarization of short and long documents, multilingual and cross-lingual summarization, and multi-document summarization. It integrates a variety of benchmark datasets, such as CNN/Daily Mail, Gigaword, Reddit TIFU, PubMed corpus, and the arXiv benchmark, among others. Moreover, the framework incorporates diverse metrics for a holistic evaluation, including BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and ROUGE-C. Through these efforts, SETS aims to facilitate a more nuanced and scalable evaluation of ATS techniques, paving the way for advancements in the field.
